<h3>Note</h3>
<p>I have tried my best to implement a function to ensure that when trying to uncheck all checkboxes, one will always remain checked.
However, I've continually run into issues and thus, the function remains faulty and commented out. As of now, when all boxes are unchecked, the application
acts as if all the boxes are checked. So if anyone is willing to play around with the function and find a solution, it'd be much appreciated. And of course,
my CSS skills are subpar so any help in that area would be great as well. :)</p>
